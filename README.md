## Welcome to otsojm's Portfolio

- 👋 I’m Otso Metsäportti aka otsojm and I'm currently studying Information technology at Haaga-Helia University of Applied Sciences (BBA) and 
      in my free time I am also really passionate to learn more about that field.
- 👀 I’m interested in Software development and Cloud services.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning more about Java, React.js, Node.js, AWS and starting with Python.
- 💞️ I’m looking to do my internship in May 2022 -->
- 📫 You can reach me at my [LinkedIn](https://fi.linkedin.com/in/otso-metsaportti).

Below you can find every project I have published at this point. I have a few more underway. I have been keeping myself busy: I am currently one year ahead with my studies compared to my peers and also I am working part-time. But you can find them here, when I am able to find the time to finish them.
