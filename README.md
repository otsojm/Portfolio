## Welcome to otsojm's Portfolio

- 👋 I’m Otso Metsäportti aka otsojm and I'm currently studying Information technology at Haaga-Helia University of Applied Sciences (BBA) and 
      in my free time I’m also really passionate to learn more about that field.
- 👀 I’m interested in software development and cloud services.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning more about subjects like Java, React.js, Node.js, AWS and starting with Python, for example.
- 💞️ I am starting the last year with my studies: last courses during January-May,
internship around May-September and writing thesis at the end of the year.

Below you can find every project I have published at this point. I have a few more underway. I have been keeping myself busy: I am currently one year ahead with my               studies compared to my peers and also I am working part-time. But you can find them here, when I am able to find the time to finish them.

During this spring you can expect me to do few projects, which are related to subjects like:

      1) React Native
      2) Database design and implementation
      3) Python
      4) React.js, Node.js/Express.js, MongoDB and AWS

🏫 GPA 4.40 from all studies and 4.75 from Software development courses.
