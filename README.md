Below you can find every project I have published at this point. I have a few more underway. I have been keeping myself busy: I am currently one year ahead with my               studies compared to my peers and also I am working part-time. But you can find them here, when I am able to find the time to finish them.

During this spring you can expect me to do few projects, which are related to subjects like:

      1) React Native
      2) Database design and implementation
      3) Python
      4) React.js, Node.js/Express.js, MongoDB and AWS

üè´ GPA 4.40 from all studies and 4.75 from Software development courses.
